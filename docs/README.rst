Do you have challanging inference problems that are difficult to solve with standard optimization and/or MCMC methods?
Are you looking to fit the same forward model to thousands or millions of observed targets?
``nbi`` may be your solution.

``nbi`` is an engine for Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) focused on out-of-the-box functionality for astronomical data,
particularly light curves and spectra.
``nbi`` provides effective embedding/featurizer networks for spectra and light-curve data, along
with importance-sampling integration that enables asymptotically exact inference so that the inference results are
interpretable and trustworthy.

Installation
------------

You may either install ``nbi`` with ``pip install nbi`` or directly from source. As ``nbi`` is currently under active development,
installing from source may be preferable at this stage.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/kmzzhang/nbi.git
   cd nbi
   pip install .

If you are using M1/M2 Mac **CPU**\ , you might want to install PyTorch from source and disable NNPACK, which is known to
reduce performance (see `issue <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/107534>`_\ ).

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
   cd pytorch
   USE_NNPACK=0 python setup.py install

Quick Start
-----------

The ``examples/`` directory contains complete examples that demonstrates the functionality of ``nbi``. A bare-bone
example below illustrates the basic API, which follows the scikit-learn style. The default featurizer network for
sequential data is ``resnet-gru``\ , which is a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture.

Here are a rule of thumb for resnet-gru hyperparameters:


* dim_in: this is your number of input data channels
* depth: number of ResNet blocks. Start near log2(L)-5, where L is length of your sequential data.
* max_hidden: Maximum hidden dimensions for ResNet. Hidden dimensions double (from hidden_conv=32 by default) every
  depth. At least a few times D^2, where D is the dimension of the physical parameter space.

.. code-block:: python

   import nbi

   # hyperparameters
   featurizer = {
       "type": "resnet-gru",
       "dim_in": 1,
       "max_hidden": 64
   }

   flow = {
       "n_dims": 1,        # parameter space dimension
       "flow_hidden": 32,  # generally no larger than max_hidden
       "num_blocks": 10    # depends on complexity of posterior shape
   }

   engine = nbi.NBI(
       flow,
       featurizer,
       simulator,
       noise,
       priors,
       device='cpu'        # 'cuda', 'cuda:0', 'mps' for M1/M2 Mac GPU
   )
   engine.fit(
       n_sims=1000,
       n_rounds=1,
       n_epochs=100
   )
   y_pred, weights = engine.predict(x_obs, x_err, n_samples=2000)

Note that currently the ``MPS`` backend (M1/M2 GPU) does not support weight normalization,
which is used by the ResNet-GRU network. You may specify 'norm': 'weight_norm' instead, although
the performance has not been examined.
